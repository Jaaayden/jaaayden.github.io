I think it will not be provided because of its notion to kill the traditional browsers.</li><li>Arc browser is based on the Chromium open-source project. What's the <strong>core experience</strong> difference compared with other browsers?</li><li>It's a minority‘s application, How's the <strong>stability</strong>?</li></ul><p>Anyway, I'll use it to replace Chrome for a short time, I'll answer the question in my workflows <strong>a month</strong> after.</p>",
