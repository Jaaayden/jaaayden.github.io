It appears that Chrome for macOS still cannot sync the keychain. However, the Arc browser could be a viable **alternative** to Safari. Nonetheless, there are some issues to consider:

- The pinned tabs in the Arc browser replace bookmarks found in other browsers. This may pose an issue if bookmarking is necessary, but it seems unlikely as this feature goes against its aim of replacing traditional browsers.

- As the Arc browser is based on Chromium open-source project, what sets it apart from other browsers?

- Since it's not widely used, how **stable** is it?

Despite these concerns, I plan to use it temporarily instead of Chrome and will provide feedback on my experience after a short time of use.
