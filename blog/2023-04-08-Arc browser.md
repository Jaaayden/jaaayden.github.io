It seems that the keychain still can't be synced in Chrome for macOS.

Otherwise, the Arc browser will be a nice alternative to Safari.

But there still exists some problems:

- The pinned tabs in the Arc browser replace the bookmarks in general browsers, what if I need the bookmark function? I think it will not be provided because of its notion to kill the traditional browsers.
- Arc browser is based on the Chromium open-source project. What's the **core experience** difference compared with other browsers?
- It's a minorityâ€˜s application, How's the **stability**?

Anyway, I'll use it to replace Chrome for a short time, I'll answer the question in my workflows **a month** after.
