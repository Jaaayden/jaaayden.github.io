It's almost the first for me to try the **Thai Food**. 

It's hard to describe its taste, it's special or a little weird? Just for me. 

However, I believe it's still worth having a try, though you probably won't love it.

BTW, the portions of the dish don't really meet our stomachs, maybe you need something else to fill your stomach, such as Scallion pancake.
