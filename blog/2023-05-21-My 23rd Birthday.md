The first time to Qiantan Shanghai on my 23rd birthday. 

Waked up early to collect X-Ray diffraction data in SSRF. Maybe it's the third time I go to SSRF, wish the data could be processed without a hitch.

Take a break and it came dinner time. It's the second time I heard that Guizhou cuisine, especially the sour fish, tasted like the **soak soup**ðŸ˜…. And the **Houttuynia cordata** brought me back to my life in Western China.

After dinner, we have a walk to the Huangpu River, the wind is soft, but unfortunately, it's going to rain...

Nice day!

Thank @chenj for the egg tart, meat floss shellfish, and wife cake, it's a really special gift.

Thank @yefeng for your greeting, though the wrong time.

Thank my family and all my friends for the help in my life.
