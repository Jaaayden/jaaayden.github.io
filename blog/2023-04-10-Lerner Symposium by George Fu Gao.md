George Fu Gao gave an excellent speech.

Dr. Gao's English pronunciation and delivery were impressive. Despite the inconvenient timing of the event, it was a valuable experience.

Dr. Gao is highly regarded due to his recent [nature article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06043-2), which sheds light on the distribution and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan Seafood Market during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no direct evidence supports that SARS-CoV-2 originated from animals.

Furthermore, I would like to share with you all a quote by Lu Xun that Dr.Gao mentioned: 

>  "Wasting time is murder." 

This resonates with me deeply as well. **We share the same aspiration.**
