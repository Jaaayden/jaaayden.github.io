Nice speak from **George Fu Gao**.

Honestly, Dr.Gao's English pronunciation and appeal are both good. Although the time of this event is not very friendly to me, it's still a perfect experience.

Dr.Gao is very popular these days because his [nature article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06043-2) provides information about the distribution and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan Seafood Market during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, in brief, there is no direct evidence to prove that the SARS-CoV-2 comes from the animal.  

Aside from that, I would like to share with you guys that the saying by LuXun cited by Dr.Gao is:

> "Wasting time is murder."

**We share the same aspiration.**
