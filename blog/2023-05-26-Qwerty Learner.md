It's really confusing for the first time to type English words on the keyboard cuz it's really different from the Chinese input method. 

Here comes the [Qwerty Learner](https://qwerty.kaiyi.cool), a really useful tool for learning English methods, and for non-native English speakers, it can also act as software to recite words.

Qwerty Learner is [open source](https://github.com/Kaiyiwing/qwerty-learner) and maybe I will deploy it on this website one day.
