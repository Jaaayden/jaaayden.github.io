ChatGPT is so impressive in the field of generating many kinds of texts.

Interestingly, a tool called [GPTZERO](https://gptzero.me) has existed to detect whether the texts are generated with ChatGPT.

However, it is not very common to hear that the texts generated by ChatGPT are forbidden nowadays. Wait and see.
