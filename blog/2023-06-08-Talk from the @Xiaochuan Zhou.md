Before coming to ShanghaiTech University, I never expected that so many famous and influential individuals would come here to give talks on important societal topics.

Today, we are honored to welcome Xiaochuan Zhou, the Former Governor of the People's Bank of China, Vice Chairman of Boao Forum for Asia, and Vice Chairman of the 12th CPPCC National Committee.

The talk focuses on Payment Systems and Digital Currency. This is an invaluable opportunity for me to gain insights into global currency regulations. Additionally, Principal Jiang shares his thoughts on the Internationalization of the CNY, which is definitely worth considering.
