# RSSHub



## Why did I deploy it?

If **RSS** is one of your most important ways to get information, you must know that the official RSSHub server is **not** always available due to the block from some website providers.

Thus, it's necessary to deploy a self-host RSSHub service to figure it out.

## Quick start

1. [rss.zengxud.top](https://rss.zengxud.top)
2. Enjoy it!

## My usage

> If you want to refer to my method to use RSS or you haven't decided whose service or reader to use. I list them. Forgive me that's all I can provide.

It's not a specification that tells you how to use RSS to get your everyday information. I just share the RSSHub service with you. If you have any questions, I have **reached a cooperation with Google**, be free to google it, it's OK!
