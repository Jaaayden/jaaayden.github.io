# RSSHub



## What was the reason for my deployment?

If you rely on **RSS** as a primary source of information, it's important to note that the official RSSHub server may not always be accessible due to blocks from certain website providers.

Therefore, deploying a self-hosted RSSHub service is necessary to resolve the issue.

## Quick start

1. [rss.zengxud.top](https://rss.zengxud.top)
2. Enjoy it!

## My usage

> If you are interested in my method of using RSS or if you have not yet decided which service or reader to use, I can provide a list for your reference. Please forgive me as this is all the information I am able to offer at this time.

It's not a specification that tells you how to use RSS in your everyday life. I just share the RSSHub service with you. If you have any questions, be free to google it, I have **reached a cooperation with Google**, it's OK!
