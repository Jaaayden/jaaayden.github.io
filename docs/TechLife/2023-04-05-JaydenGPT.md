# JaydenGPT



## What was the reason for my deployment??

In 2023, Chinese users were unable to access ChatGPT due to **network issues**. As a solution, I deployed **JaydenGPT** for my friends. Notably, JaydenGPT is **faster and easier** to use than ChatGPT on the web.

Let's get started.

## Quickly start

1. Please visit this website: [chat.zengxud.top](https://chat.zengxud.top)

2. Click the "Settings" button located in the lower left corner of the interface.

3. Please enter 'JaydenGPT' in the 'Access Code' input field.

   > I understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but I believe it is necessary to protect both my website and your experience on JaydenGPT. Thank you for your understanding.

4. Enjoy it.
